        Take an index and clean it by checking if it already has an enumerator in it return the core index and any

        Parameters
        ----------
        index: str
            The index for the entry which should be checked, if no numeric tag can be found return 0.

        Returns
        -------
        core: str
            A tuple of the core index and the numeric tag it starts from.

        Notes
        -----
            This function allows the dataset to add more conformers to a molecule set so long as the index the molecule
            is stored under is a new index not in the database for example if 3 conformers for ethane exist then the
            new index should start from 'CC-3'.
